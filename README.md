# MPMB XUA25EU "Eberron Updates"
This script adds the Artificer & its subclasses from both the 2024 *Unearthed Arcana: The Artificer* article, as well as the Cartographer subclass for the Artificer and the Dragonmark Feats from the *Unearthed Arcana: Eberron Updates* article.

**This script is to be used in conjunction with the 5.24E scripts by ThePokésimmer. It will not work properly without those installed first. You can find those scripts here: https://github.com/thepokesimmer/2024-PHB/tree/main This script supersedes (and is therefore incompatible with) my previous UA Artificer script.**

**Script Credit Note:**
This file has been compiled by MasterJedi2014, though the bones of the script are based on the code from MPMB and those who have contributed to the sheet's existing material in the "all_WotC_pub+UA" script. I am also using code within the script written by the users Shroo, ThePokésimmer, & TrackAtNite. The only things in this script that I can currently take credit for are:
- Alterations made to address changes made by the UA;
- Converting the Homunculus Servant infusion into a spell, along with the needed `CompanionList` & `CreatureList` entries.
- The non-spell granting aspects of the Dragonmark Feats.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the revised Artificer & Eberron content. It also includes options to re-enable some aspects of the 2019/2020 Artificer that might be needed for an existing character to function.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2025-02-01:**
  - Initial upload of script (V2).

**Known Bugs:**
- V2: +2 Armor, Shield, Wand of the War Mage, Weapon, & Wraps of Unarmed Power don't appear in their correct menus.
- V2: The level 10 "Replicate Magic Item" options are being addd to the level 6 options immediately upon the character attaining level 6.
